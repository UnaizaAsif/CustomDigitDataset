This folder stores the generated dataset files after running the CustomDigitDataset tool.

Files that will be created:

- images.bin → Contains 28x28 grayscale image data of drawn digits.
- labels.bin → Contains the labels (0–9) corresponding to each image.

These files are generated at runtime by main.cpp. 
They are used later in the KNN digit recognition project.
