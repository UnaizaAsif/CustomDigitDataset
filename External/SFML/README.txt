This folder is intended to store the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) files required to build and run the CustomDigitDataset project.

It may include:
- SFML headers (e.g., Graphics, Window, System)
- SFML DLLs or compiled binaries (for local use only)
- Any SFML configuration or linking files

Note:
- Large or compiled files like `.dll` or `.lib` are typically excluded from version control.
- Please download SFML separately from: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
- Ensure your local CMake or build configuration points to this folder correctly.
